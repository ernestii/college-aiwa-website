						h1 About us
						p Aiwa has a simple formula for delivering serious audio equipment without compromise - we have the best acoustic talent and we put our money into the components that deliver the best sound, instead of the marketing of that equipment.
						
						p Aiwa is for those that want music to be more than background noise, for those who want the music to have the power to entertain.
